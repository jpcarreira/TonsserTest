# TonsserTest

This project was built with ***Xcode 9.4.1*** and run on ***macOS High Sierra 10.13.6***.

It consists on a *UI challenge* (a simple iOS app that shows Tonsser followers for a given user in a table view, with "infinite" reloading) 
and an *algorithm challenge* that can be found in the playground with the same name. Two examples of RXSwift were developed in the this demo 
(the table view is bound to an observable datasource and the profile view count is also displayed using a Rx technique)   

This projects uses 3 dependencies, managed by Cocoapods, so in order to build and run the app you should open the xcworkspace file and run 
`pod install`
